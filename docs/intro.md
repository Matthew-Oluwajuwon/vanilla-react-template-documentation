A minimal and fast React template powered by Vite, designed to kickstart your React projects with sensible defaults.

## Features

- **Fast Development**: Utilizes Vite for rapid development and hot module replacement.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

You can easily create a new project using this template with the following command:

During the installation, you'll be prompted to enter:
